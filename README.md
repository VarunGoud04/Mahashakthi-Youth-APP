## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for building a Flutter mobile application.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Firebase account for backend services (Firestore, Auth, Storage)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mahashakthiyouthapp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd mahashakthiyouthapp
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

---

## Firebase Setup

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. Add an Android/iOS app in the Firebase project.
3. Download `google-services.json` (for Android) and/or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) and place them in the respective directories:
   * Android: `android/app/`
   * iOS: `ios/Runner/`
4. Enable Firebase services:
   * **Firestore Database:** For storing events, gallery data, and user profiles.
   * **Firebase Auth:** For OTP verification login.
   * **Firebase Storage:** For storing images and videos.
5. Initialize Firebase in `main.dart`:

   ```dart
   void main() async {
     WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
     await Firebase.initializeApp();
     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```

---

## Usage

- Users can register as **Committee Members** or **Guests (Visitors)**.
- Committee Members require admin approval before accessing full features.
- Guests can login directly using OTP verification.
- Navigate through the bottom navigation bar to access events, gallery, announcements, and profile.
